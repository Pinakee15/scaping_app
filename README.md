# DentalStall Scraper Tool

## Overview

A FastAPI-based tool to scrape product information from [DentalStall](https://dentalstall.com/shop/). It extracts product names, prices, and image URLs, stores them in a SQLite database, caches the data, and upon re-scraping, only stores new data and updates existing entries based on cache status. It also provides notifications upon completion.

## Features

- Scrape product details from multiple pages with optional limits.
- Supports proxy settings for scraping.
- Stores data in a SQLite database with easy extensibility for other storage methods.
- Notifies via console output after scraping.
- Implements type validation, retry mechanisms, authentication, and caching using Redis.
- Modular and extensible design using Object-Oriented Design principles and the Strategy Pattern.
